# Introducing LabInaBox

Do you have a need to spin up a sandbox lab environment quickly to test DSC configurations, updates or really anything?  In writing DSC configurations over the last year I have found the need to do this often.  To simplify things I put together a few configurations and scripts to assist going forward.  The solution can be found in a GitHub repo along with the documentation on how to get started.  Stay tuned as updates will be coming to enhance this in the future.
